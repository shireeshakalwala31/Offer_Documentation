     ↓

## Key Points

✅ **Password is generated by system** (not by candidate)  
✅ **Password sent in email** (candidate copies from email)  
✅ **No password reset needed** (one password per link)  
✅ **Can save halfway** (link stays active)  
✅ **Link expires only after completion** (all sections + declaration)  
✅ **Can resume anytime before completion** (data saved)
